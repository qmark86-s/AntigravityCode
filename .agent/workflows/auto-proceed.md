# Auto-Proceed Rules

When working on tasks:
1. Do NOT wait for user approval on implementation plans - proceed directly to execution
2. Set `ShouldAutoProceed: true` when using notify_user for progress updates
3. Only stop for user input when explicitly requested or when there's a critical decision needed
